# Tailwind CSS standards and best practices

## Core Principles
- Use utility classes instead of custom CSS when possible
- Follow the project's @tailwind.config.js configuration
- Maintain consistent spacing and sizing throughout the project
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS variables for theme values
- Maintain accessibility standards with proper contrast and sizing

## Class Organization
- Group Tailwind classes in a logical order:
  1. Layout (display, position, etc.)
  2. Sizing (width, height)
  3. Spacing (margin, padding)
  4. Typography (font, text)
  5. Visual (colors, backgrounds)
  6. Interactive (hover, focus)
- Use the `cn()` utility for conditional classes
- Extract repeated class patterns into reusable components

## Responsive Design
- Start with mobile designs and add complexity at larger breakpoints
- Use standard breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl) consistently
- Avoid design jumps between breakpoints
- Test thoroughly across various device sizes
- Implement responsive typography using appropriate scales
- Use container queries for component-specific responsiveness

## Theme Customization
- Define custom colors in the @tailwind.config.js
- Create semantic color variables (primary, secondary, etc.)
- Extend the theme rather than overriding defaults
- Define consistent font sizes and spacing scales
- Create custom plugins for project-specific utilities
- Use presets for shared configurations across projects

## Dark Mode
- Implement class-based dark mode strategy
- Use dark: variants for dark mode specific styling
- Ensure proper contrast in both light and dark modes
- Test color combinations for accessibility
- Use CSS variables for theme switching
- Implement user preference detection

## Performance
- Use PurgeCSS in production to remove unused utilities
- Avoid excessive arbitrary values
- Minimize usage of @apply in CSS files
- Create component abstractions for repeated patterns
- Use proper caching strategies for CSS files
